It is a project based on Airbnb, but with a new perspective. Connect developers that want to visit companies and companies that are open to this.

This project would be the tool for managing, the following features: 

- **Company user** 
   - Register the company in the app (Company user is gonna be able to register more than one company).
   - It is gonna be able to accept or denied requests.
   - Upload pictures
   
- **Developer user** 
  - Register you own user in the app.
  - Make a request to visit a company. (One user can make many requests to different companies) 
  - Get a notification with the result of the request (it can be accepted or denied).
  
**Note:** Recover password and change profile information will not be developed on this first moment for both users' views.
